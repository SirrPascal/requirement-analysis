## Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to exploring the process of requirement analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This process is crucial for ensuring all stakeholders have a clear, shared understanding of how the system will operate and what its projected performance will be.



## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis (or Requirements Engineering) is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It acts as the  bridge between the business needs of stakeholders and the detailed technical "blueprint" that developers will use to build the software.

It answers the fundamental questions:
* **What** should the system do? (Functional requirements)
* **How well** should the system do it? (Non-functional requirements)
* **What constraints** must it operate under? (Business rules, technical constraints, etc.)

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1.  Helps define the scope of the project to prevent **scope creep**.
2.  Provides a solid foundation on which the design and development of the system can begin.
3.  Ensures the team can accurately estimate the project cost, resources, and development time.
4.  It helps to make sure that the specified requirements match the customer's and stakeholders' expectations.
5.  **Reduces overall project cost** by catching errors and misunderstandings early. A mistake fixed in the requirements phase is 100x cheaper than fixing it after the product is built.

   ### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

**1. Requirement Gathering:**
This is where the requirements are gathered via various methods like interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and even document analysis.

**2. Requirement Elicitation:**
Here, ideas are generated and requirements are gathered. Finally, prototypes are created to visualize the system, and requirements are refined.

**3. Requirement Documentation:**
All functional and non-functional requirements are written down. It is in this step that user stories are written and use case diagrams are drawn.

**4. Requirement Analysis and Modelling:**
Requirements are prioritized based on importance and impact on the project. Feasibility analysis is done on the requirements based on different factors, and models are created to visualize the requirements.

**5. Requirement Validation:**
Requirements are reviewed to ensure they meet the required accuracy. Acceptance criteria are drawn up, and traceability matrices are created to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.
